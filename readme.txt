=  Amazing Visual Examples =
Gutenspot converts boring pages or posts into into amazing visual examples which will certainly draw attention of your visitors..


In order to avoid design or color conflict we took care and added color pickers for pointers, tooltips and text. 

Additionally there is an ability and define position of the tooltips not to cover each other if they are placed too close and make it display on hover, on click or all the time. 

The main point is that you can edit it visually using WordPress Visual Builder and without any coding experience at all.

Hotspots can be triggered via click & hover or have them opened by default (always opened). Also they have a nice pulsing effect.
